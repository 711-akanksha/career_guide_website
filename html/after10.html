        <h1 class="stream-sel">Stream Selection</h1>
        <p>The most important decision after class 10 is opting for the right stream of study. Selecting the right stream is really important as your future depends on it. Stay away from the herd mentality of going for the course your friends are enrolling for or the one your parents are suggesting. This erroneous and perilous practice often leads to faulty career choices as in doing so you opt for the stream without actually understanding what lies in store after joining it.</p>
        <h2>Science</h2>
        <p>The subjects studied in this course are Physics, Mathematics, Chemistry, Biology, Computer along with English and a vernacular language, depending on the board and medium you opt for.
            <br> <br>If you choose Medicine over Engineering then the subject offered other than the above mentioned is Biology. It has career choices in two courses which are Engineering and Medical Sciences.
            <br> <br>In Engineering, you need to understand concepts while in Medicine, you need to memorize them. Engineering requires analytical thinking and grasping power while Medicine requires memorization and learning skills. For taking up Engineering you should take up PCM (or MPC) and for Medicine, you should take up PCB (or BiPC) combination.
            <br> <br>  Science is the most sought after the course and one that almost every parent wants their child to take up as this stream has a number of rewarding career opportunities including engineering, medical, and research in different domains.
            <br><br> Another major advantage is that it allows students to change streams and take up Arts or Commerce later in their lives if they are not at ease with programs or specializations available at the graduation level.
           <br><br>Quite the reverse is the case of Arts or Commerce students who cannot elect to choose science subjects at the undergrad level. Those aspiring to be engineers should opt for PCM or Physics + Chemistry + Mathematics as core subjects, or one can go for PCMB i.e. Physics + Chemistry + Mathematics + Biology, especially if medical is the career goal.</p></br>
        <h2>Commerce</h2>
    <p>Best for Business, commerce is known as the second most popular stream. If you are fascinated by numbers, finances, and economics, commerce is for you. The stream has promising and handsomely paying professions like Chartered Accountants, Company Secretaries, Accountants, Investment Banking and Financial Advisors. However, one has to enroll for professional courses in the respective domains after completing class 12. These include B.Com, BBA, BMS, BBM, CFA, CA, ICWA, CFP etc.
    </p><br><br> 
        <p>Subjects include Business Economics, Accountancy, Business Study and Business Law. Besides, basic knowledge of accounting, auditing, income tax, marketing, and general business economics will also be imparted. Compulsory language subject/s will be there.</p>
         <h2> Arts/ Humannities</h2>
         <p>
            Humanities or Arts hitherto known as the least preferred stream and limited to students who were interested in academic research, is now emerging as a sought after career choice as today there are opportunities galore in this domain including some interesting, off-beat and exciting career options. Arts now offer an array of career alternatives which are equally rewarding and fulfilling as the ones offered by Science or Commerce streams.
            <br><br>
           One can opt for career paths in Mass Media, Journalism, Literature, Languages, Social Service, History, Geography, Political Science, Psychology, Sociology, Anthropology, Human Resources, and Economics.<br><br>
There is a variety of subjects to choose from including sociology, history, literature, psychology, political science, philosophy, economics etc. Besides, in addition to the compulsory language, students have the option to opt for a second language as well.</p>
